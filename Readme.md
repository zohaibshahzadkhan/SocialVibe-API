  - **`account/`**: Django app for user account management.
    - Contains user models, views, serializers, and tests related to user accounts.
  - **`post/`**: Django app for managing posts.
    - Includes post models, views, serializers, and tests.
  - **`search/`**: Django app handling search functionality.
    - Contains search views, serializers, and tests.
  - **`media/`**: Directory for storing media files uploaded by users (configured in Django settings).
  - **`staticfiles/`**: Directory for static files (e.g., CSS, JavaScript) collected during deployment.
- **`.gitignore`**: File specifying which files and directories Git should ignore.
- **`Procfile`**: Configuration file for specifying process types in Heroku deployment.

### Project-Level `backend/` Directory

#### `backend/`

This directory contains the project-level settings and configurations for the SocialVibe API backend.

- **`settings.py`**: Django settings file defining project settings, database configurations, middleware, etc.
- **`urls.py`**: URL configuration file defining API endpoint routing.
- **`wsgi.py`**: WSGI config for deployment.
- **`asgi.py`**: ASGI config for deployment with async support.

## App-Specific Details

### `account/`, `post/`, `search/`

## Agile Development

### About

Agile development is adopted to efficiently manage the development process of the project, ensuring flexibility and iterative improvements.

### User Story Template

Using GitHub issues, a user story template was created to define features and tasks for the project. The template categorizes tasks into three labels: must have, could have, and should have.

</details>

### Kanban Board

The project's progress and task status are visualized through a Kanban board. Each task is represented as a card that can be moved across columns indicating its current statusâ€”todo, in progress, and completed.

### MoSCoW Prioritization

MoSCoW prioritization technique is employed to prioritize project requirements based on their importance and urgency. This ensures that essential features are addressed first, followed by those of lower priority.

- `_create_user`: Creates a user with normalized email and hashed password.
- `create_user`: Creates a regular user with default permissions.
- `create_superuser`: Creates a superuser with admin permissions.

### Methods and Functions

- `created_at_formatted`: A method in models like Comment and Post to format `created_at` field to human-readable time since creation.

### Default Image URLs

- **User Avatar:**
  - If `avatar` field is not set, a default image URL is used.
  - Example: [Avatar](https://res.cloudinary.com/dceudxuqq/image/upload/v1718720898/media/profile_gs8tic.png)

- Authentication: Obtain a JWT token using /api/login/ or /api/signup/ endpoints.
- Accessing Endpoints: Include the obtained token in the Authorization header (Authorization: Bearer <token>) for accessing protected endpoints.


## Testing 

A separate testing document has been created as [Testing.md](Testing.md)

## Validation

### Python
- **CI Python Linter**: Python files were validated using CI Python Linter.

## Deployment
### Cloning & Forking
#### Fork
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the [zohaibshahzadkhan/SocialVibe-API](https://github.com/zohaibshahzadkhan/SocialVibe-API) repository.
2. In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
3. By default, forks are named the same as their parent repositories. You can change the name of the fork to distinguish it further.
4. Add a description to your fork.
5. Click Create fork.

#### Clone
1. Above the list of files click the button that says 'Code'.
2. Copy the URL for the repository.
3. Open Terminal. Change the directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
4. Type git clone, and then paste the URL
5. Press Enter.

### Local Deployment
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the [zohaibshahzadkhan/SocialVibe-API](https://github.com/zohaibshahzadkhan/SocialVibe-API) repository and clone it.
2. Once you clone the repository you will need to install the libraries, you can do this by typing "pip3 install -r requirements.txt" into the terminal from root directory of the project.
3. Rename sample_env.py to .env file and change the key pair values to match your credentials. There is a [sample env file](./sample_env.py) that you can use. 
4. Run `python3 manage.py runserver` from the root directory to run server locally

### Remote Deployment 
1. Log in to Heroku
2. Click 'Create new app'.
3. Give your application a unique name, select a region appropriate to your location and click the 'Create app' button.
4. You can use an external database for example postgre or use 'Heroku Postgres' under the Add-ons section.
5. Go to settings section and click 'Reveal Config Vars' in the Config vars section.
6. Add CLOUDINARY_URL and the value as your cloudinary API key.
7.  Add SECRET_KEY and the value as a complex string which will be used to provide cryptographic signing.
8.  Add DATABASE_URL if you are using a different database than Heroku Postgres.
9.  Add ALLOWED_HOST it will be deployed URL of the Api.
10. Add CLIENT_ORIGIN it will be the frontend application interacting with the API. 
11. Navigate to the 'Deploy' page
12. Select 'GitHub' from the 'Deployment method' section
13. Enter your github account details and select the forked/ clone repository.
14. Select 'Manual deploy', select the 'main' branch in the drop down and click the 'Deploy' button.
15. Once built, click the 'View' button to load the URL.

### Database
A Postgres database instance has been used for this project, provided by CodeInstitute.

If you wish to use ElephantSQL follow these steps

1. Open your web browser and go to the [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) website.
2. Sign up for a free account or log in if you already have an account.
3. Once you have logged in, you will be taken to the Dashboard. From here, click on the "Create New Instance" button.
4. You will now be taken to a page where you can configure your new database instance. Choose the "Tiny Turtle" plan which is free.
5. Select the region where you want to host your database. The closest region to you is usually the best choice.
6. Choose a name for your instance, this will be the name of your database.
7. Choose a username and password for your instance.
8. Click on the "Create" button to create your new database instance.
9. The database url was stored in a config var: 'DATABASE_URL' on Heroku. This variable was then used in the settings.py to connect to the database.
10. Click on the "Details" tab to view your instance details.
11. Look for the "URI" field, which contains the connection details you need to connect to your database. The URI should start with: 'postgres://'

The models were migrated to the database by entering the following commands in the terminal:

```
python3 manage.py makemigrations

python3 manage.py migrate

```
